this directory stores the sumoconfig files, additional files required to run sumo simulations and the output files. They define what and where the input files are (such as routing, what network to use, etc) and where to put the output files (logs)

By default, these files are generated by the scripts/generatesumocfg.py script.

At this point (2022/1/30) we have not yet implemented passed arguments for the script. You might have to look at the code and make changes yourself if you want more customized scenarios.

```
\evacgreensboro\scripts> py .\generatesumocfg.py
```
