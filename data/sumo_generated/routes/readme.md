this directory stores the route files that sumo uses to determine which path each of the vehicles will take.

By default, these files are generated by calling the duarouter command line tool provided by sumo, while passing in the flows file and the network file. Example:

```
duarouter --unsorted-input=true --route-files=../sumo/flows/citycenter_w0_m1.flows.xml --net=../sumo/network_data/greensboro/greensboro.net.xml --output-file=../sumo/routes/citycenter_w0_m1.rou.xml
```

Where: 
- --route-files specifies which flows to perform routing on. See the readme.md under `sumo/flows/` to learn more about flows files.
- --net specifies the network/topology of the area being evacuated.
- --output-file specifies where to put the output .rou.xml file and what to call it.
